# Phenesthe

_Phenesthe_ (orig. φαίνεσθαι) is a system for the representation and processing of instantaneous and durative temporal phenomena. Temporal phenomena may be:
- events (instantaneous)
- states (durative)
- dynamic temporal phenomena (durative)

Given an input stream of input phenomena _Phenesthe_ will produce the instants or intervals at which user defined temporal phenomena are true or hold. More details can be found in "M. Pitsikalis, A. Lisitsa, and S. Luo, “Representation and Processing of Instantaneous and Durative Temporal Phenomena,” in Logic-Based Program Synthesis and Transformation, vol. 13290, E. De Angelis and W. Vanhoof, Eds. Cham: Springer International Publishing, 2022, pp. 135–156. doi: 10.1007/978-3-030-98869-2_8."

## Features

- A user friendly language that allows the definition of temporal phenomena
- Formal description of the semantics and execution semantics
- An engine that allows the recognition of the instants and intervals at which the user defined phenomena are true/hold
