# Phenesthe+

_Phenesthe+_ (orig. φαίνεσθαι) is an extension of Phenesthe. Phenesthe+ is system for the representation and processing of instantaneous and durative temporal phenomena. Temporal phenomena may be:
- events (instantaneous)
- states (durative)
- dynamic temporal phenomena (durative)

Given an input stream of input phenomena _Phenesthe+_ will produce the instants or intervals at which user defined temporal phenomena are true or hold. _Phenesthe+_ compared to _Phenesthe_ allows the definition of event and states with future dependencies. The future dependecies can be expressed with the minimal range operator and filtering.

## Features

- A user friendly language that allows the definition of temporal phenomena
- Formal description of the semantics and execution semantics
- An engine that allows the recognition of the instants and intervals at which the user defined phenomena are true/hold

## Documentation
Up to date docs in progress.

## Disclaimer

While _Phenesthe+_ has undergone through testing, it's still under development.  Therefore some bugs may exist :) .
