## Installation

Running _Phenesthe_ requires a prolog installation. Specifically it has been tested under <a href=\"www.swi-prolog.org\">SWI-Prolog</a>  7.6.4.
You can download the latest version of _Phenesthe_ using the command below:
```
git clone https://github.com/manospits/Phenesthe.git
```
Once downloaded, and provided that you have SWI-Prolog installed, _Phenesthe_ is ready to run. You can confirm that you have a working version of _Phenesthe_ by navigating to the ``unit_tests`` folder and running the unit tests.

```
cd unit_tests
./run_tests.sh
```
