## Overview

_Phenesthe_ (orig. φαίνεσθαι) is a system for the representation and processing of instantaneous and durative temporal phenomena. Temporal phenomena may be:
- events (instantaneous)
- states (durative)
- dynamic temporal phenomena (durative)

Given an input stream of input phenomena _Phenesthe_ will produce the instants or intervals at which user defined temporal phenomena are true or hold. 
### Features

- A user friendly language that allows the definition of temporal phenomena
- Formal description of the semantics and execution semantics
- An engine that allows the recognition of the instants and intervals at which the user defined phenomena are true/hold.
